    Limelyte has one of the best open office environments I have had the pleasure to work in. There's tons of project variety ranging
    from background investigation, real estate, ecommerce, intranet tools, etc... . I even got to work on an app in Ionic with Angular!
    Unfortunately I was probably never going to make more than $55k. And I wanted to work on mobile apps fulltime, which wasn't going to happen
    to due a background investigation heavy clientele.
