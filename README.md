# vue-random-that

## Summary
This project was an attempt to showcase a proof of concept for a ionic mobile app using Vue as the renderer. Where there would be a tab navigation system with each tab having it's own navigation history. A local database to facilitate offline first functionality and act as a part of the global state for the app, which could be used reactively. Other minor things include FAB menus, Page template, sliding item actions, etc...
